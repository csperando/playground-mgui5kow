# Input Output (I/O)

Many of you reading this have probably come from [Code in Game](https://www.codingame.com/), where most of the file management has been automated for you. However, as you progress through different community puzzles you may want to work out more complex examples for yourself or even make your own contributions. 
If this is the case, or if you're just curious, then you might be interested in learning some of the basics of working with your own files. The good news is that this is incredibly easy! There are essentially only 4 things you need to do in order use your own data in a python script.

* Import os
* open(filePath, "mode")
* parse the data from the file
* close()

## The Python OS Library

For full documentation read the [Python os docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html).

At the beginning of your script you need to include ```import os```. This will allow you to use two very important functions: ```open()``` and ```close()```.

## Open

## Close

## How to Actually Get Your Data

This is arguably the most important step in this process. 


# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced Python template](https://tech.io/select-repo/429)
